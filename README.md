🚗 Car Rental System (Java Console Application)

This project is a Java-based console application that simulates a simple Car Rental Management System. It allows users to rent and return cars through an interactive menu-driven interface. The system manages cars, customers, and rental records using object-oriented programming principles.

✨ Features

Display available cars for rental

Rent a car by entering customer details and rental duration

Automatically calculate total rental cost based on days

Confirm or cancel rental before final booking

Return rented cars and update availability

Menu-driven console interface for easy interaction

🛠️ Technologies Used
